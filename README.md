## Something About Me
I learn the basics of coding and development from online courses.
The essential part I learn and practice from various projects, tutorials, documentation and forums.
I originally started with Python and Django, but when I discovered React and Next.js I knew I wanted to stick with it for a long time.

## Even More...
Sports have been in my life since I was 7 years old. I have been involved in various sports, but swimming is my favority.
